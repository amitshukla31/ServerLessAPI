The Serverless API we are building! The api directory contains five files.

    beta.json: The CloudFormation staging file. This will be used by CloudFormation to pass parameters to our CloudFormation template.
    buildspec.yml: This is used by CodeBuild in the build step of our pipeline. We will get to that later.
    index.js: The Lambda function code!
    package.json: The package.json that defines what packages we need for our Lambda function.
    saml.yaml: SAML my YAML! This is the SAM template file that will be used to create our API gateway resource and Lambda function, hook them up together
